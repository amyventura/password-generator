# password-generator
This has been the most difficult homework so far. I did not know where to start from and even when I was given the psuedo code, I was still confused. When I finally did understand the logic, I was unable to figure out how to code it correctly. My password generator does not generate a password and I was not able to figure out what I did wrong or what I needed to add to make the code work. I also had a lot of difficulty formatting the code and figuring out what functions to use. I found that I kept repeating myself and I did not know how to make the code easier to read and more condensed.
I was able to add the prompts and confirms to get the users input for their password. I also wrote the conditional statements if the user did not input the correct information for the generator. I added an event listener to start the user prompts when the button is clicked.
